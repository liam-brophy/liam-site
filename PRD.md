# Project Requirements Document: Portfolio Website Development (MCP)

## 1. Introduction & Goals:

### Project Title: Portfolio Website Development

### Project Overview: 
Development of a personal portfolio website to showcase design and development skills, using an agentic assistant guided by Model Context Protocol.

### Goals:

- Agent-driven code generation for efficient and accurate development.
- Creation of a responsive and visually appealing portfolio website.
- Showcase full-stack design and development capabilities.

### Target Audience:

- Hiring managers
- Recruiters
- Potential clients
- Peers in the design and development community

## 2. Scope & Features:

### In-Scope Features: 
The agent should generate code for the following sections:

#### Homepage:

- Clear introduction and call to action.
- Visually engaging display of featured projects.

#### Work Section:

- Detailed presentation of full-stack applications (including links to live sites, and integration of design process).
- Showcase of design work (books, reports).

#### Laboratory Section:

- Presentation of interactive experiments.

#### About Section:

- Personal narrative, skills overview, and professional philosophy.

#### Contact Section:

- Contact form and links to professional profiles.

### Out-of-Scope Features (for initial phase): 
(To be defined - helps the agent know what not to focus on)

### Future Considerations: 
(Optional features for later development)

## 3. Technical Specifications (Crucial for MCP):

### Core Technologies:

- **Front-end Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: (Specify: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, etc.) - Provide examples if possible.
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Language**: TypeScript

### Data Model (If Applicable):

If there's any data persistence, define the schema. Even for simple things, this is good practice for the agent.

Example (if you were to have a database of projects - you might not for a static portfolio, but for illustration):

#### Tables:

- **Projects**:
  - project_id (INT, Primary Key)
  - title (VARCHAR)
  - description (TEXT)
  - technologies (VARCHAR[])  // Array of strings
  - live_url (VARCHAR)
  - design_process_details (JSON) // For site sprints, identity packages
  - project_type (ENUM: 'web_app', 'design', 'experiment')

#### Relationships: 
(If applicable)

(e.g., if you had a table of "Skills" and a table of "Projects", you might define a many-to-many relationship)

### API Endpoints (If Applicable):

(If your portfolio needed to fetch data - which is less likely for a static portfolio, but again, for illustration)

Example:

- **GET /projects**: Returns a list of all projects.
- **GET /projects/:id**: Returns a specific project.

### Component Library/Style Guide (Highly Recommended for Agent Consistency):

Provide examples of React components you envision. This is extremely helpful for an agent.

Example:

- **ProjectCard Component**:
  - Props: title, description, imageUrl, liveUrl, technologies
  - Structure: (Provide a basic JSX structure)
  - Styling: (Provide Tailwind classes or CSS Module examples)

- **Button Component**:
  - Props: variant (primary, secondary, link), children, onClick, href (optional)
  - Styling: (Tailwind examples for each variant)

### State Management:

(Even if you think you don't need state management, state it. "Local component state only" is a valid answer)

- **State Management**: Local component state (using useState, useReducer). No global state management library is required.

## 4. Design & User Experience (UX) - Provide Visual Examples for the Agent:

### Overall Aesthetic:

- **Keywords**: "Bespoke," "Trustworthy," "Calm," "Seamless"
- **Visual Examples**: (Include links to websites, mood boards, or style guides that exemplify these qualities. This is critical for the agent to understand your design vision).

### Layout and Navigation:

- Provide wireframe examples or sketches if possible.
- Describe the intended user flow.

### Typography:

- Specify font families.
- Provide examples of heading and body text styles.

### Color Palette:

- Provide specific colors (hex codes).
- Show how colors should be used for different elements.

### Responsiveness:

- **Target Devices**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **Breakpoints**: (Specify pixel values)
- **Layout Examples**: (Show how the layout should adapt on different screen sizes)

### Accessibility:

(Even basic accessibility guidelines are helpful for the agent)

- Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
- Semantic HTML.
- Keyboard navigation.
- Sufficient color contrast.

## 5. Content Requirements:

- **Text Content**: "Text content is prepared." (Agent should use provided text)
- **Visual Assets**: "Visual assets (demos, GIFs, images) are prepared." (Agent should use provided assets)
- **Links**: "All necessary links (live sites, social media, "Laboratory") are prepared."

## 6. Development Process for Agent (MCP Specific):

- **Initial Code Generation**: The agent should generate the initial codebase based on the specifications in this PRD.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Expect multiple iterations of code generation and refinement based on feedback.

- **Communication Protocol**: (Define how you will communicate with the agent - what format, what frequency, etc.)

- **Version Control**: The agent should use Git for version control. Specify the branching strategy (e.g., main branch for final code, feature branches for individual sections).

- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for core components.
  - Manual testing for overall functionality and visual appearance.

- **Documentation**: The agent should provide clear and concise code comments.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria:

- The portfolio website meets all the requirements outlined in this PRD.

- The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.

- The website is responsive, accessible, and performs well.

- The agent has followed the specified development process.
